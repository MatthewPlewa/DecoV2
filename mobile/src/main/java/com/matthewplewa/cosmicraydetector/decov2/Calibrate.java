/**
 * Created by Matthew on 8/11/2014.
 * The goal of this class is to create a calibrtion system that will be able to determine the proper
 * x and y scaling that needs to be done inorder to have a quaue of one or less. This will also set up
 * the r g and b values that will trigger the system to run a full image filter rather than a scaled image filter.
 * This should be run for 25 or more photos to get a decent aproximation of the values needed.
